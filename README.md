### Abstract
Brazil has been faced outbreaks of arbovirus-related infections such as Chicungunya, Zika and Dengue fevers, and some of them have a proven association with neurological disorders in newborns. It triggered a worldwide alert concerning dengue, chikungunya and zika viruses infection, which are transmited by the <i>Aedes sp</i>. mosquitoes. To fight the spread of <i>A. aegypti</i> in Brazil, primary care technicians (ACSs and ACEs) are acting as the main vectors of health surveillance measures. Data gathered in their visits, such as local and time helps public health managers to define to which areas control measures might be taken. We propose a georeferenced and time-indexed visualization strategy of the area covered by technicians, with specific indication of visited homes. Results points to more efficient possibilities to plan control of the <i>A. aegypti</i> reproduction and a clear visualization of areas at risk.
